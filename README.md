This repository presents a comprehensive end-to-end MLOps project designed to detect malicious URLs using XGBoost, ensuring user safety by identifying harmful links through machine learning. The project integrates a variety of tools and best practices to build a robust, scalable, and production-grade MLOps pipeline. By combining data ingestion, model training, deployment, and monitoring, it provides a complete solution for real-time and batch URL safety assessments.

## Introduction

Malicious URLs are links that lead to harmful websites, often used by cybercriminals through phishing emails, social engineering, and other tactics. This project detects malicious URLs using machine learning and provides both single URL predictions and batch predictions through an interactive UI.

## Dataset and Features

The dataset contains **30 features** extracted from URLs, which help classify them as **Malicious** or **Safe**.

### Key Features

| **Feature Name**           | **Description**                                                                                   |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `having_IP_Address`        | Checks if the URL contains an IP address instead of a domain name, which can be a sign of phishing.|
| `URL_Length`               | Measures the length of the URL; longer URLs are often used to hide malicious content.            |
| `Shortening_Service`       | Detects the use of URL shortening services like `bit.ly`, often used to disguise harmful links.  |
| `having_At_Symbol`         | Flags the presence of '@' in the URL, which is sometimes used to obscure the real destination.   |
| `double_slash_redirecting` | Identifies if there are multiple slashes after the protocol, which can indicate redirection.     |

| **Feature Name**           | **Description**                                                                                   |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Prefix_Suffix`            | Checks for the use of dashes ('-') in the domain, commonly used in phishing URLs to spoof legit domains. |
| `having_Sub_Domain`        | Counts the number of subdomains; excessive subdomains are often used to make a URL appear legitimate. |
| `SSLfinal_State`           | Analyzes the SSL certificate; no SSL or a self-signed certificate may indicate an unsafe URL.    |
| `Domain_registration_length` | Measures the duration of domain registration; shorter registration lengths are common for malicious sites. |
| `Favicon`                  | Checks the favicon‚Äôs source; a mismatch between favicon and domain may indicate phishing.        |
| `port`                     | Detects if any unusual ports are being used, which can indicate malicious activity.             |
| `HTTPS_token`              | Flags the use of 'HTTPS' as part of the domain name, which could be a misleading tactic.         |
| `Request_URL`              | Checks if resources (e.g., images, scripts) are loaded from different domains, which may be suspicious. |
| `URL_of_Anchor`            | Analyzes the percentage of anchors (`<a>` tags) pointing to a different domain.                  |
| `Links_in_tags`            | Measures links found inside certain HTML tags like `<meta>`, `<script>`, and `<link>`.           |
| `SFH` (Server Form Handler) | Checks if the form action points to suspicious locations, which could indicate data theft.      |
| `Submitting_to_email`      | Flags URLs that allow form data to be directly submitted to an email, a sign of a phishing attempt.|
| `Abnormal_URL`             | Identifies URLs that do not match their domain, suggesting a discrepancy between URL and content.|
| `Redirect`                 | Counts the number of redirections (`3xx` responses); excessive redirects may indicate phishing.  |
| `on_mouseover`             | Detects if JavaScript `onmouseover` events are being used to change the link destination, tricking users.|
| `RightClick`               | Identifies if right-clicking is disabled, which may indicate attempts to prevent users from inspecting elements.|
| `popUpWindow`              | Flags the presence of pop-up windows, often used for deceptive ads or malicious content.        |
| `Iframe`                   | Detects the presence of invisible iframes, which are often used to load malicious content silently.|
| `age_of_domain`            | Analyzes the domain age; new domains are often used for malicious activities.                   |
| `DNSRecord`                | Checks if the domain has missing DNS records, indicating an untrustworthy website.              |
| `web_traffic`              | Measures the website's traffic volume; low or no traffic may indicate a potentially dangerous URL. |
| `Page_Rank`                | Checks the page rank of the URL; low rank could mean it is not a well-known or trusted source.  |
| `Google_Index`             | Identifies if the URL is indexed by Google; non-indexed URLs might be suspicious.                |
| `Links_pointing_to_page`   | Counts links pointing to the webpage; few or no inbound links may indicate a new or untrustworthy website.|
| `Statistical_report`       | Flags URLs reported for suspicious activity or listed in blacklists.                             |

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Fetched data directly from **MongoDB**.
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff806462-7b17-48a3-bad1-cd6f2186a72c)
      ```python
      def export_collection_as_dataframe(self):
          try:
              database_name = self.data_ingestion_config.database_name
              collection_name = self.data_ingestion_config.collection_name
      
              with pymongo.MongoClient(MONGO_DB_URL) as mongo_client:
                  collection = mongo_client[database_name][collection_name]
      
                  # Logging to verify if collection has data
                  count = collection.count_documents({})
                  logging.info(f"Number of records retrieved from MongoDB: {count}")
      
                  if count == 0:
                      raise ValueError("No records found in MongoDB collection. Please check the data source.")
      
                  df = pd.DataFrame(list(collection.find()))
                  if "_id" in df.columns.to_list():
                      df = df.drop(columns=["_id"], axis=1)
      
                  df.replace({"na": np.nan}, inplace=True)
                  logging.info(f"Dataframe shape after exporting from MongoDB: {df.shape}")
      
                  return df
      
          except pymongo.errors.PyMongoError as e:
              raise NetworkSecurityException(f"MongoDB error: {str(e)}", sys)
      ```

   - Cleaned the data by replacing missing values (`na`) with `np.nan` and dropping unnecessary columns like `_id`.
   - Exported the processed data to a **feature store** for further usage.
   - Split the data into **training** and **testing** datasets, ensuring no data leakage.

2. **Data Validation**:
   - Validated the schema to ensure all required columns are present.
   - Checked numerical columns for correctness and detected **data drift** using statistical tests.
   - Generated detailed drift reports to monitor dataset consistency.

3. **Data Transformation**:
   - Applied preprocessing steps, such as imputing missing values using a **KNNImputer**.
   - Prepared the data into transformed **NumPy arrays** for model training.
   - Saved the transformation pipeline as an artifact for future use.

4. **Model Training**:
   - Trained an **XGBoost Classifier** on the preprocessed data.
   - Performed overfitting and underfitting checks using metrics like **F1-score**.
   - Saved the trained model along with its preprocessing pipeline as a **pickle file**.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Compared the new model with the existing deployed model (if available).
   - Evaluated metrics such as **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-score** using **MLflow** for tracking.

     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09a004b7-5452-4349-81f8-fe54b54208d2)
     - While the model shows signs of overfitting, the primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of a robust CI/CD pipeline.
      Model optimization can be addressed as a future enhancement.

   - Ensured that any new model provides measurable improvement before acceptance.

6. **Model Pusher**:
   - Saved the trained model to the **"saved_models"** directory for production deployment.
   - Uploaded the model and related artifacts to **AWS S3** for centralized storage.
      - "networksecuritymlops" bucket is used to store artifacts and models
